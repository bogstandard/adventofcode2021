# Advent of Code 2021 Submissions
Repo for submissions to Advent of Code 2021, golfed.

These answers are golfed & scored on the [Lapland Golf Club pastures](https://bogstandard.github.io/lapland-golf-club/).

These answers are done in Bash 3 on MacOS, just to torture myself.

Some enjoyable quirks of Bash 3;
- No proper Associatative Arrays
- No proper matrices support
- Struggles with larger variables

Some of these answers are great, some absolutely abysmal. They aren't intended to be legible or fast, just small character counts.
